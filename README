This distribution contains the modules Filesys::Statfs

DESCRIPTION
Filesys::Statfs provides an interface between
Perl and the statvs() system call.

SYNOPSIS Filesys::Statfs

use Filesys::Statfs;

	  my($ftype, $bsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
             $files, $ffree) = statfs("/tmp");


INSTALL
TO INSTALL RUN:
	
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

For this module to install and work properly you will need
to have the statfs() system call on your system. A good way
to tell if you have it is to look for the sys/statfs.h header
in your include directory. (Usually /usr/include/)

If there is an error during the 'make', it is
possible that you do not have statfs() on your system.
Another possible reason may be that the statfs structure defined
in statfs.h does not contain one or more of the fields that are
defined in Statfs.xs.

During the 'make test' test.pl will use statfs()
to stat the root directory "/". If it fails it will
report an error, otherwise it will report all the 
standard fields in the statfs structure. If you

Once installed, run 'perldoc Filesys::Statfs' for more information. 

If you have any problems or questions please email
me at IGuthrie@aol.com with "Filesys Module" in
the subject line.

This module will be combined with Filesys::Df in the near future
to provide more user friendly information.
